## Good practices

### In the team

* Regular team one on one feedback session. Every pair have around 5 minutes, 2 minutes to come up with ideas and 3 minutes to talk. Then one person switch to another persion.
* Regular team retrospective, each retro should check the previous actions, and have some actions as outputs.
* Daily standup
* Have some story wall, no matter physical or on the website.
* Team health check survey and metrics report. About how do people feel about the team? How to people like to work in team? Any obstacles?
* Regular team outing/ team building. The simplest one is the team lunch, so people can know more to each other.
* Regular team technology people catch up. Talk about the tech decisions, tech debts and improvments.

### Among teams/Company

* Regular whole office standup, one people stands for each team.
* Regular office update, Q&A
* Regular office tech people meeting.
