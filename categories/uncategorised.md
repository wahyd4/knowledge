## Some interesting questions

### UUID or UUID4

* `UUID` use current time and your computer MAC address to generate the id
* `UUID4` which is much simpler. Each and every bit of a UUID v4 is generated randomly and with no inherent logic. With the sheer number of possible combinations (2^128), it would be almost impossible to generate a duplicate unless you are generating trillions of IDs every second, for many years.
